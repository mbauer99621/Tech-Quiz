# Tech Quiz Application

## Description
The Tech Quiz application is a full-stack web app that allows users to take a quiz of ten randomly generated tech-related questions and receive a final score. 
The application has been enhanced by adding Cypress tests, covering both **component testing** and **end-to-end (E2E) testing**.

## Features
- Users can start a quiz with ten random questions.
- Final score is displayed upon completion.
